=============================
Linking Cython to C Libraries
=============================

Here we'll go through an example using Cython in Python
while also linking to an external C or C++ library. This
requires some special considerations, but shouldn't be too
involved. It requires use of `pxd`, `pyx`, and `py` file
formats.

The guide I'll use is at guide_.
